    <div class="description">
        <p class="Massoud">Hi my name is Maja, i'm a 24 year old dane who currently live in Ringsted.
        I come from a family of 5, where im the oldest out of 3 siblings. I have a slightly different cultural backgroun,
        as my father comes from Libanon. I never learned how to speak arabic, we do however visit his
        side of the family as often as conflict allows. I decided to start on IT-Architekture as i think
        it aligns well with my personal interest.

        I always have something to do when I get home, i'm quite good at busying myself.
        in my sparetime I love to read, listen to music, embroider, crochet, knit, draw, sewing, gaming
        and I volunteer. I volunteer for RUF (Ringsted Ungdoms Forum) where my main task is to set up event for
        people within the age of 18-25. This will be my second year doing this, and some of the assignments I'm currently
        working on are a sushi event and a D&D event. The premise for what we do is to create comunities and spaces for
        people who might have a hard time socializing or just moved to the city without having a base.
        I quite enjoy the work, albeit a lot of the other member are around 4-5 years younger than I.

        When i read i mainly read high fantasy, and my alltime favorite book series is Eragon by Christopher Paolini.
        I have always loved the idea of magic and dragons. I grew up with folklore as my bedtime stories, and
        have always been encouraged by those around me to let my imagination run wild. I collect book series that i enjoy
        and me and my roommate are around 5 books away from being able to call our collection a library(for it to classify as a library
        it most contain 1000+ books). This year alone i have read 25 new books, and i'm currently working throug Priory of the Orange tree.
        <br>

        Music is with me pretty much all day. I always have my headset with me, and i almost always have my headset on.
        I listen to a plethora of different artist, but some of the artist i listen to the most are Sleep Token, Ed Sheeran and
        Bad Omens. I use music as a tool. Sometimes the world can get to loud, so i use the music and my headset as a barrier that often
        helps me keep focus.
        <br>
        <br>
        I grew up with arts and crafts. I'ts something my mothers side of the family cared a lot about, so i started learning the different
        art pretty early on. Anything from weaving to sewing really. I have a lot of really good memories from my childhood,
        where i would spend weekends or afternoons after school with my granma where we would sit with a good cup of
        tea and some project we were working on.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started playing games pretty early on. I started with Playstation and Nintendo, and as i got older i gravitated
        towards pc. My friend introduced me League of Legends and Warframe, and i have been playing ever since. At the moment
        mostly League of Legends, Dead by Daylight, Peak, Lethal Company, Repo and Sea of thieves. I mostly play co-op games
        and i usually do so with some of my friends of England and Austria.
